1.Tree traversals
Pre-order (NLR)
post-order(LRN)
In-order (LNR)
Level order
vertical order traversal (using level order or recursive  using Pre-order using treeMap DS compare HD or VD (HD less than or Hd1 == hd2 then vd1 selected)

2. all views
Left view
Right view
Bottom view
Top view
Diagonal left view ( Left view with keeping right HD as same) , similarly to Diagonal right view
Print tree in Spiral or ZigZag order ( 1. using 2 Stack 2. using Deque)

3. Height of the tree
4. Diameter of tree ( longest distance between two leaf node ..  need not be through root node)
5. LCA
6. Tree is BST or not
7. path from root to leaf node
