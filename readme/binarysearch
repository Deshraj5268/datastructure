Observation :
0. by default Element should be unique and element in ascending/increasing order [99.99] case but ask is element in ascending or desc
1. reducing by 2 : n/2, n/4 , n/8 ... n/2^k = 1 , [ k = logn]
2. multiplying by 2 : 2, 2^2 , 2^3 ... 2^k = n [ k = logn]
3. Binary Search on Answer Concept [sorted by nature ex. 0,0,0,0,0,0,.... 1,1,1,1 --> find position of starting one [2nd approach ]]

1. First/last occurrence of target element in sorted array , follow up count of repeated element.
2. Number of time a sorted array rotated
