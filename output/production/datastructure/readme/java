Arrays.sort() vs Collections.sort() time complexity :
Arrays.sort() uses a Dual-Pivot Quicksort algorithm which gives a
 time complexity of O(N.log N) which is typically faster than traditional
  Quicksort algorithms. On the other hand, Collections.sort() creates an
   array of list elements, sorts them using an adaptive Mergesort algorithm,
    and iterates over the list to position each element at its correct location.
     Thus for primitive datatypes like int, char, double, etc. Arrays.sort()
     proves to be way more time efficient than Collections.sort(). Problems
     involving primitive datatypes
 should be tried to solve using Arrays.sort() for better optimisation.
