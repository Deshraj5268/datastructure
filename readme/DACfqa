>Given the sorted rotated array nums of unique elements, return the minimum element of this array in O(log n) time.

>Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in an m x n matrix. This matrix has the following properties:
Integers in each row are sorted from left to right.
The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.

>Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order with O(log n) runtime complexity.

>Given the array nums after the possible rotation and an integer target, return the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums.

>Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).
