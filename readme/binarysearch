Binary search in array : https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search/discuss/423162/Binary-Search-101
1. Array element should be unique or sorted in NATURE ( 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 --> find first index of 1 or 1 2 3 5 6 7 8 search target

Observation :
0. by default Element should be unique and element in ascending/increasing order [99.99] case but ask is element in ascending or desc
1. reducing by 2 : n/2, n/4 , n/8 ... n/2^k = 1 , [ k = logn]
2. multiplying by 2 : 2, 2^2 , 2^3 ... 2^k = n [ k = logn]
3. Binary Search on Answer Concept [sorted by nature ex. 0,0,0,0,0,0,.... 1,1,1,1 --> find position of starting one [2nd approach ]]
4. What's important is that we think of binary search array as some array with
   Prefixes of True(T) and Suffixes of False(F) OR
   Prefixes of False (F) and Suffixes of True(T) OR
   All True(T)
   All False(F)

1. First/last occurrence of target element in sorted array , follow up count of repeated element.
2. Number of time a sorted array rotated
